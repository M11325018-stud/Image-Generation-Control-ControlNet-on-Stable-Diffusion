# Image-Generation-Control-ControlNet-on-Stable-Diffusion
Developed a ControlNet-based conditional image generation pipeline on Stable Diffusion v1-4, enabling geometric control in generated results. The model accurately captured shape and position, achieving Mean Score (IoU×CLIP)=0.6581 / Final IoU=0.6581 (≈ 20% above class average), though color control remained limited under data constraints.
